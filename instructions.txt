TASK: Create clean upstream Growatt Server custom component for HACS distribution
Goal: Create a base custom component repository that mirrors the latest Home Assistant Core Growatt Server integration, properly structured for HACS installation.
Repository Structure to Create:
growatt_server_upstream/
├── custom_components/
│   └── growatt_server/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── const.py
│       ├── coordinator.py
│       ├── sensor.py
│       ├── config_flow.py
│       ├── models.py
│       ├── manifest.json
│       ├── strings.json
│       └── translations/
│           └── en.json
├── README.md
├── DELTA.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── info.md
├── hacs.json
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── release.yml
Step 1: Create the core component files
Extract the current Growatt Server integration files from Home Assistant Core repository (https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/growatt_server) and copy them to custom_components/growatt_server/:
Files to copy exactly as-is:

__init__.py
const.py
coordinator.py
sensor.py
config_flow.py
models.py
strings.json
translations/en.json (and any other translation files)

Step 2: Create manifest.json
Create custom_components/growatt_server/manifest.json:
json{
  "domain": "growatt_server",
  "name": "Growatt Server Upstream",
  "codeowners": ["@johanzander"],
  "config_flow": true,
  "documentation": "https://github.com/johanzander/growatt_server_upstream",
  "iot_class": "cloud_polling",
  "issue_tracker": "https://github.com/johanzander/growatt_server_upstream/issues",
  "loggers": ["growattServer"],
  "requirements": ["growattServer==1.7.1"],
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
Step 3: Create HACS configuration
Create hacs.json in repository root:
json{
  "name": "Growatt Server Upstream",
  "content_in_root": false,
  "render_readme": true,
  "domains": ["growatt_server"]
}
Step 4: Create info.md
Create info.md in repository root:
markdown# Growatt Server Upstream

Upstream development version of the Growatt Server integration for Home Assistant.

## What is this?

This repository serves as an upstream testing ground for improvements to the Growatt Server integration before they are submitted to Home Assistant Core.

## Current Status

**Base Version**: Latest Home Assistant Core Growatt Server integration  
**Enhancements**: Additional improvements will be added incrementally

## Installation

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
2. Install "Growatt Server Upstream"  
3. Restart Home Assistant

Step 5: Create README.md
Create README.md in repository root:
markdown# Growatt Server Upstream
